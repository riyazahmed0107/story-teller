        <h1>The Star in the Sky</h1>
        <p id="para1">
            <span>I</span> was sitting in class when I first saw it.

            Miss Weaver had been my teacher for a few months, and was known around Stagwood Elementary for the stack of black hair that rose a foot above her head. Before the school year started, I’d heard a few rumors about her, and within a week I realized that they were all true. For one thing, she did, in fact, wear the same outfit every day; the colors changed, but she always had on striped pants and a striped jacket. For another thing, she was mind-numbingly boring. It was the kind of boring that made your eyes shut without permission. The biggest problem, though, was the stories. She was obsessed with tales of former students who had become some kind of famous. The first couple of times weren’t bad, maybe even kind of interesting. But, by the second week of school she had started repeating herself, just like her outfits. 
        
            By then, I knew all the stories by heart. The professional football player who got excellent marks in Math. The State Senator who was a teacher’s pet. I knew every word. So, instead of trying my hardest to listen, I spent most of class drawing in my notebook.“For the sake of Elephant, Owl and Baby Turtle, Moon and I have decided to share

            the sky. When I rise, Moon will set and leave the sky bright.  When Moon rises, I will set and leave the sky dark.
            
            "Moon will bring the tides each day as she travels through the sky and it will be cool and dark." Sun continued. "And when I rise, I will once again make the sky bright..."
            
            But we need one of you tell us when it is time for us to switch.”
            
            “It cannot be me,” said Elephant, “for I am forgetful.” 
            
            And this was a lie.
            
            “It cannot be me,” said Owl,” “for I cannot be trusted.”
            
            And this was the truth.
            
            “It cannot be me,” said Baby Turtle, “for I am just a baby.”
            
            And this could not be argued.
            
            One by one, the animals declined except for Dullfly, who was resting in the shade of a banana leaf.
            
            Sun shone his great heat on Dullfly and spoke to him a booming voice. “Dullfly, this is Sun! Do you hear me?”
            
            “From now on, you will tell me when it is time for me to set, and we will call it dusk. And you will tell Moon when it is time for her to set, and we will call it dawn.”
            
            “I cannot!” Dullfly said, frightened by Sun’s loud command. “I am too small for you to see!”
            
            Sun exhaled and shot a burst of light straight into Dullfly’s body, making it glow brightly.
            
            “There. From now on you will be known as Firefly, and you will flash your light to send us a signal,” said Sun. And from that day forth, Firefly did just that.
            
            So, if you happen to catch Firefly at dawn or dusk, you must be sure to let him go, because it is he who decides when Moon brings the tides, and when Sun rises and sets.

        <h1>The Blue Planet</h1>
        <p id="para2"><span>R</span>aymond flew his ship straight out of the galaxy. Through an asteroid field and beyond a large star field, Raymond found a small blue planet. He lowered his ship to find a place to land, but didn’t have much luck. Almost every inch of the planet was covered with water!

            There was a river of rocks flowing nearby. Raymond couldn’t land on the rocks or his ship would be tossed and turned. Instead, he pushed a big red button, and his spaceship turned into a space-submarine (it was by far, his favorite button to push!). Once the submarine was underwater, he turned on the lights so that he wouldn’t miss seeing any of the planet’s underwater creatures.Hours later, he came upon a sea castle with many doors (when it comes to underwater castles, even windows can be used as doors since you can swim right in). Raymond parked his space-submarine outside the sea castle, put on his underwater suit, and swam inside. 

            Raymond entered a great hall which was beautiful, but empty, except for a large fish sitting on a throne. 
            
            “Huzzah, Huzzay, who comes my way?” asked the Fish King.
            
            “It is I, Raymond Mayweather, space traveler extraordinaire and friend to all who swim in the sea. Might I ask, where are all the other sea creatures hiding?” 
            
            
            “They’re not hiding,” answered the Fish King. “I ate them all up, and now I am hungry again. What kind of delicious fish are you?”The Fish King liked his lips and eyed Raymond up for a snack. Raymond smiled and slowly backed up towards the nearest door.

            “I’m a human,” said Raymond, as he turned to swim away. “Quite poisonous for Fish Kings to eat!” he shouted as he left the sea castle.
            
            
            Raymond hopped into his space-submarine and tried to drive away as fast as he could in the opposite direction, but his controls weren’t working. Suddenly, he was pulled out of his ship by a whirlpool and spun around in the water. Soon, he and his sub were sucked in completely! The whirlpool took them in and spit them out through a fountain of water on the other side of the planet. He fell onto a patch of grass underneath a large tree, and his ship surfaced nearby. </p>
